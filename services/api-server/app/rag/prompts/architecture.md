{parent_context}

## Question
{query}

- Explain how components relate to each other
- Use bullet points or a simple diagram (ASCII) if helpful
- Reference specific modules and their responsibilities
- Highlight key patterns used (e.g., "repository pattern", "event-driven")
- If the context is insufficient, clearly state what's missing

Keep the explanation at the right level of abstraction - architecture, not implementation details.
