## Instructions
Write proposal-ready prose that can go directly into a document with minimal editing.

Structure your response with these sections (skip any that aren't relevant):

### Technical Approach
- How we would implement the solution
- Reference our existing patterns and code where applicable
- Be specific about architecture choices

### Key Components
- What pieces we already have
- What would need to be built or customized

### Integration Points
- How this connects to client systems
- APIs, data flows, authentication

### Risk Mitigation
- Known challenges and how our approach addresses them

Guidelines:
- Reference specific capabilities from the context
- Mark gaps as [GAP: description] where we need more input
- Professional tone - no marketing fluff
- Specific over vague - "our FastAPI microservices" not "our robust backend"
- Realistic scope - don't overpromise
