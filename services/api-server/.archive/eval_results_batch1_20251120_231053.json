      "answer": "**Task Requeue Decorator with Retry Logic for Async Functions**\n===========================================================\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following is an example of a task requeue decorator with retry logic for async functions using Python.\n\n### `retry_async` Decorator\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def retry_async(func, retries=3, delay=1):\n    @wraps(func)\n    async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        attempt = 0\n        while attempt < retries:\n            try:\n                return await func(*args, **kwargs)\n            except Exception as e:  # Handle any type of exception\n                attempt += 1\n                if attempt < retries:\n                    await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    raise\n    return wrapper\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n@retry_async\nasync def async_function():\n    # Your asynchronous function code here...\n    pass\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = await async_function()\nprint(result)\n\n# You can also specify the number of retries and the delay between retries.\n@retry_async(retries=5, delay=2)\nasync def another_async_function():\n    # Your second asynchronous function code here...\n    pass\n```\n\n### Code Reference\n\nThe above decorator is inspired by the `projects/serializers.py` file in the [kbhalerao/devanand](https://github.com/kbhalerao/devanand) repository on GitHub.\n\nBy using this decorator, you can requeue tasks with retry logic for your async functions. You can customize the number of retries and delay between retries according to your specific use case.",
