## Instructions
Write a summary suitable for including in proposals or presentations.

Structure:
1. **Relevant Experience** - Projects and work that relate to this domain/technology
2. **Key Capabilities Demonstrated** - What we've proven we can do
3. **Technical Depth** - Specific technologies, patterns, and approaches we've used
4. **Outcomes** - Results and impact where available

Guidelines:
- Reference specific projects from the context
- Focus on demonstrated expertise, not theoretical capability
- Mark gaps as [GAP: description] if experience is limited
- Professional tone suitable for client-facing documents
- Quantify where possible ("processed 10M records" not "handled large datasets")
