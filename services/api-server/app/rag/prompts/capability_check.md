## Instructions
Answer format:
1. **Can we do this?** - Yes / Partially / No / Need more information
2. **Evidence** - Cite specific projects, code, or briefs that demonstrate the capability
3. **Gaps** - What we don't have evidence for (mark as [GAP: description])
4. **Approach** - Brief outline of how we'd deliver this based on existing capabilities

Guidelines:
- Be honest - don't claim capabilities we can't demonstrate

- "Partially" is a valid answer when we have some but not all pieces
- Focus on business value, not just technical details
- If we'd need to build something new, say so
